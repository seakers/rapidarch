function [sh_scores_sym] = svn_analysis_sym(A, sh_names, central)
% [scores,ranked_sh] = svn_analysis_sym(A, sh_names, central)
% This function performs a stakeholder value network analysis as proposed
% in Cameron, B., “Value flow mapping: Using networks to inform stakeholder analysis,” 
% Acta Astronautica, vol. 62, Feb. 2008, pp. 324–333.
%
% Added symbolic capabilities to deal with unknown variables 
% indicating value flows. 
% In this case the variables must be declared as syms and the A matrix must
% contain these syms
% Example: 
% syms alpha_c alpha_sg
% A = [0 0.5 0.8 0 0 0;alpha_c 0 0 0 0 0;0.5 0 0 0.8 0 0;0 0 0 0 alpha_sg 0.3;0.5 0.3 0.3 0 0 0.3;0 0 0 0 0.8 0]
% A is a square matrix representing the value flows between pairs of
% stakeholders. A(i,i) =0 \forall i
% sh_names is a cell of strings with the names of the stakeholders
% including the central stakeholder. 
% central is a string containing the name of the central stakeholder
%
% Example: 
% sh_names = {'project','customer1','customer2','scientists','government','public'}
% central = 'project'
%
% The function performs the following steps:
% Compute all cycles starting and ending with 'central' stakeholder
% Compute the scores of all these cycles
% Compute importance of stakeholder i as the sum of the scores of all cycles
% that start and end with 'start' and go through stakeholder i
%
% Returns sh_scores_sym as a function of variables indicating value flows. 
% Note that the current version computes the scores but does not solve the system of inequalities
% that would be required to rank the stakeholders as a function of the
% variable value flows.%
